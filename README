WHAT IS THIS?

This is a header-only parser for the GTF file format. If you are unaware of
what that is, then this is almost certainly not meant for you.
This class can read and write GTF files. See USAGE for more information.

BUILDING

This program assumes a modern C++ compiler, preferrably compatible with C++17.
