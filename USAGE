HOW TO USE THIS CLASS

These are the steps to open, load, and iterate through a GTF file:
  1. Make an instance of GTFFile
  2. Supply a filename via either the constructor or using setfilename()
  3. Use load() to load the file into memory
  4. Use a range-based for-loop to iterate through the file, retrieving
     each line as a GTFSequence (excluding comments and other invalid lines)

Extra functions:
  - You can get a filtered list of sequences from the file with the filter function

For a more specific code example, see test/test.cpp.
